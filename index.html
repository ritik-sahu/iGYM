            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Gillen’s first run in early 2017 was unexpectedly painful, leading her
                to seek medical attention. Multiple visits with an orthopedist, along with two MRIs (magnetic resonance
                imaging scans), revealed that Gillen’s knee discomfort was due to a loss of cartilage under her
                kneecaps. She had to spend months in physical therapy and doing strength-training exercises before she
                was able to run again.
                <br><br>
                The unintentional time off resulted in a loss of fitness. For years, she used running as a way to clear
                her head and zone out. But post-injury, things were different. “I had to be very aware with each step,”
                Gillen says. “I basically had to relearn how to run,” she says.

                She couldn’t go as fast or as far, and she couldn’t zone out because she was so focused on maintaining
                her form and not overdoing it. Although Gillen was thrilled to be able to run again, it was months
                before the movement felt as natural and effortless as it had before.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There’s not much evidence on how fitness continues to decrease after
                several weeks of total inactivity, but those in “good cardiovascular shape will take up to a few months
                to completely lose all of [their] aerobic fitness,” Campbell says, adding that the timeline is relative
                to each individual’s capabilities.
                <br><br>
                Also keep in mind that unless someone is injured, a break in their regular exercise rarely means
                complete inactivity. In the literature review cited above, the evidence suggests that cardiovascular
                fitness of regular exercisers starts to decrease significantly after about 35 days (five weeks) of
                occasional, light exercise. So, that means if you were exercising a lot and then drastically reduce the
                intensity of your workouts, you might also notice a decrease in cardiovascular fitness.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">“No matter your fitness level and how that changes throughout your
                journey, there are many ways to get activity into your day,” says Kayla Jeter, a Road Runners Club of
                America–certified running coach and WW D360 coach based in Chicago. Body-weight exercises (no gym or
                equipment required), hiking, or or even gardening are good options, she adds.
                <br><br>
                Campbell recommends light training, including body resistance exercises that don’t lead to an elevated
                heart rate, to limit the loss of strength, and points to the proliferation of fitness apps as aiding
                this endeavor. Of course, if you’re taking a break due to injury or for another medical reason, it’s
                important to clear all activity with your doctor.
